# Camera-calibration-of-the-reflected-images
Single reflected images are first flipped to undo the reflection.\
Modification of matlab camera calibration for backside checkerboard images.\
Camera calibration steps.\
1. Square checkerboard of 20mm on both side.\
2. Checkerboard placed in between the mirrors.\
3. Capture all the reflected checkerboards.\
4. Split the image into five with equal dimensions.\
5. flip the single reflected images.\
6. Separated checkerboard images are fed into Matlab for  calibration.\
7. Modification of Matlab calibration for backside view of the checkerboard image.\
8. Matlab assigns number for the corners.\
9. Incorrect assignment of number for back view.\
10. After modification assignment of correct numbering.\
